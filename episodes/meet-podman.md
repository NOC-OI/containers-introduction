::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain how to check that Podman is installed and is ready to use.
- Demonstrate some initial Podman command line interactions.
- Use the built-in help for Podman commands.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I know Podman is installed and running?
- How do I interact with Podman?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Podman command line

Start the Podman application that you installed in working through the setup instructions for this session. Note that this might not be necessary if your laptop is running Linux or if the installation added the Podman application to your startup process.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## You may need to login to Docker Hub

The Podman Desktop application will usually provide a way for you to log in to
the Docker Hub via the 'Settings' menu followed by 'Registries' and then
'Configure' under the Docker Hub entry. It is usually convenient to do this when
the application starts. This will require you to use your Docker Hub username
and your password. We will not actually require access to the Docker Hub until
later in the course but if you can login now, you should do so.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Determining your Docker Hub username

If you no longer recall your Docker Hub username, e.g., because you have been logging into the Docker Hub using your email address,
you can find out what it is through the steps:

- Open [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/) in a web browser window
- Sign-in using your email and password (don't tell us what it is)
- In the top-right of the screen you will see your username
  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once your Podman application is running, open a shell (terminal) window, and run the following command to check that Podman is installed and the command line tools are working correctly. Below is the output for a Mac version, but the specific version is unlikely to matter much: it does not have to precisely match the one listed below.

```bash
$ podman --version
```

```output
podman version 5.4.2
```

The above command has not actually relied on the part of Podman that runs containers, just that Podman
is installed and you can access it correctly from the command line.

A command that checks that Podman is working correctly is the `podman container ls` command (we cover this command in more detail later in the course).

Without explaining the details, output on a newly installed system would likely be:

```bash
$ podman container ls
```

```output
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
```

(The command `podman system info` could also be used to verify that Podman is correctly installed and operational but it produces a larger amount of output.)

However, if you instead get a message similar to the following

```output
Cannot connect to Podman. Please verify your connection to the Linux system using `podman system connection list`, or try `podman machine init` and `podman machine start` to manage a new Linux VM
Error: unable to connect to Podman socket: failed to connect: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:63249: connect: connection refused
```

then you need to check that you have started the Podman Desktop application or Podman Machine or however else you worked through the setup instructions.

## Getting help

Often when working with a new command line tool, we need to get help. These tools often have some
sort of subcommand or flag (usually `help`, `-h`, or `--help`) that displays a prompt describing how to use the
tool. For Podman, it's no different. If we run `podman --help`, we see the following output (running `podman` also produces the help message):

```

We can view further help on the individual Podman commands by adding `--help` to that command. For example, take the `podman container ls` command that we ran previously. We can see from the Podman help prompt that `container` is a Podman command, so to get help for that command, we run:

```bash
podman container --help  # or instead 'podman container'
```

```output

  -w, --watch uint           Watch the ps output on an interval in seconds
```

You may notice that there are many commands that stem from the `podman` command. Instead of trying to remember
all possible commands and options, it's better to learn how to effectively get help from the command line. Although
we can always search the web, getting the built-in help from our tool is often much faster and may provide the answer
right away. This applies not only to Podman, but also to most command line-based tools.

## Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) syntax

In this lesson we use the newest Docker CLI syntax
[introduced with the Docker Engine version 1.13](https://www.docker.com/blog/whats-new-in-docker-1-13/).
This new syntax combines commands into groups you will most often
want to interact with. In the help example above you can see `image` and `container`
management commands, which can be used to interact with your images and
containers respectively. With this new syntax you issue commands using the following
pattern `docker [command] [subcommand] [additional options]`

Comparing the output of two help commands above, you can
see that the same thing can be achieved in multiple ways. For example to start a
Docker container using the old syntax you would use `docker run`. To achieve the
same with the new syntax, you use `docker container run` instead. Even though the old
approach is shorter and still officially supported, the new syntax is more descriptive, less
error-prone and is therefore recommended.

## Exploring a command

Run `podman --help` and pick a command from the list.
Explore the help prompt for that command. Try to guess how a command would work by looking at the `Usage: `
section of the prompt.

podman image build --help

We could try to guess that the command could be run like this:

```bash
podman image build .
```

or

```bash
podman image build https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git
```

where `https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git` could be any relevant URL that supports a Docker-style image.
